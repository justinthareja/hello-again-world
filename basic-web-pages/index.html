        <h1>Internetting is Easy!</h1>
        <p>It's very common for the first h1 to be the same as the title</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (which stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add a list item in a "li" tag</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" that wraps the "li" elements</li>
            <li>The list items are still the same tag</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increase all by themselves</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this order because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase. An "em" tag helps here</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word. This is when a "strong" tag shines</p>
        <p>Other times still, you just need to <em><strong>shout!</strong></em> The combination of and "em" tag and "strong" tag can be quite potent</p>
        <!-- How do you handle long text when it scrolls off the screen? -->

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Hopefully internetting is a little less hard than it was before this chapter</p>

        <!-- Here the <br/> element represents a hard line break -->
        <p>Regards,<br/>
        The Authors</p>

        <!-- 
            <hr/> is a horizontal rule, representing a thematic break.
            It carries <em>less</em> significance than the separation created by a new element
            but <em>more</em> significance than a new paragraph
        -->
        <hr/>

        <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but adding CSS soon will help</p>
