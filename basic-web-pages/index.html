        <h1>Internetting is Easy!</h1>
        <p>It's very common for the first h1 to be the same as the title</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (which stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add a list item in a "li" tag</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" that wraps the "li" elements</li>
            <li>The list items are still the same tag</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increase all by themselves</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this order because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>
